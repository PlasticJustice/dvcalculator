DV Calculator 2.0B
THIS IS A BETA VERSION

THE CODE IS NOT COMMENTED, OPTIMIZED, OR STANDARDS-COMPLIANT.
After beta testing is complete the code will be refactored.
If you want to extend this application please wait until the beta test is complete!

This application began as an excel spreadsheet and has been rebuilt on different platforms 
three times before this version, so the program structure is slightly disorganized.

Please report bugs that you find!

Thanks for using the DV Calculator.
